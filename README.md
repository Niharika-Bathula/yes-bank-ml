## Yes Bank Closing Price Prediction

Business Context:


Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stockâ€™s closing price of the month.

# Overview

Predicting the closing price of stocks is essential for investors and traders to make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast the closing price of Yes Bank stocks based on historical data and other relevant features.


#Methodology

Feature Engineering

Before training the model, feature engineering is performed to extract relevant information from the raw data. This involves preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and creating additional features that may capture the underlying patterns in the stock price movements.

# Model Training

The selected machine learning model is trained using the training dataset, optimizing its parameters to achieve the best possible performance. Techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning are employed to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.

# Evaluation

Once trained, the model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance in predicting Yes Bank's closing price accurately. Various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are computed to measure the model's effectiveness.


Conclusions Drawn :



Using data visualization on our target variable, we can clearly see the impact of 2018 fraud case involving Rana Kapoor as the stock prices decline dramatically during that period.

After loading the dataset, found that there are no null values in our dataset nor any duplicate data.

There are some outliers in our features however this being a very small dataset, dropping those instances will lead to loss of information.

I found that the distribution of all the variables is positively skewed. So performed power transformation on them.

There is a high correlation between the dependent and independent variables. This is a signal that the dependent variable is highly dependent on our features and can be predicted accurately from them.

Found that there is a rather high correlation between our independent variables. This multicollinearity is however unavoidable here as the dataset is very small.

Implemented several models on our dataset in order to be able to predict the closing price and found that all our models are performing remarkably well and knn regressor is the best performing model with A R2 score value of 0.993115 and scores well on all evaluation metrics.

Conducted comprehensive bivariate and multivariate analyses to explore relationships between variables, gaining insights into underlying patterns and dynamics within the dataset.

Employed advanced regression methodologies including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net regression, leveraging their respective strengths to optimize predictive performance and mitigate overfitting.

Demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy with the KNN regressor model, achieving an outstanding R2 score of 0.993115, indicative of its superior performance and potential practical application in real-world scenarios.
